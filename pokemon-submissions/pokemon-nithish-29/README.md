* ## API's
    We have used two API's to fetch pokemon data.
    
    First viste [pokemon's website](https://pokeapi.co/).

    One of the API contains the 1000+ pokemons data.
   ```js
    https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
    ```
    After fetching data form this API and converted data into Js-object, it contains name and url of each pokemon data. Next used name of pokemons to get data.
    ```js
    https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name-of-pokemon}/
    ```
  The application processes the data from the main API, converting it to a JavaScript object and subsequently fetching detailed information for each Pokemon.
  >NOTE: Use catch to display error while fetching the API's
